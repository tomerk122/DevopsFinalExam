# DevopsFinalExam
# in the second build we are copying the dependencies from the first build to the second build
# if we want to test it localy, we can run those commands:
# docker build -t my-python-app .
# docker run -p 5001:5001 my-python-app

our application is not fix yet so we get an error in the section 3, debug we will fix it.
